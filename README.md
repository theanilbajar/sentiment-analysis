## Sentiment Analysis

- Data loading
- Cleanup and text embedding strategy
- Create Sklearn Pipeline to train and deploy model with preprocessing steps.
- Model Evaluation
- Save model

## Deployment Options
- FastAPI with Google App Engine - Completed
- Vertex AI Model Registry with Endpoints - In-progress

## Future Scope
- Move model accuracy:
    - Using better text embedding techniques
    - Better model than RandomForest or try hyperparameter tuning

- Deploy model keeping cloud costs in mind. Google App Engine might be costly as it a managed service.
